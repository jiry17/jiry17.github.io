<p>
Hello,  I am Ruyi Ji (吉如一). Welcome to my home page.

</p>

<p>

I'm now a fourth-year PhD student in the <a href="https://pl.cs.pku.edu.cn/en/">Programming Language Lab (PLL)</a> at <a href="http://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="http://sei.pku.edu.cn/~hu/">Zhenjiang Hu</a> and Prof. <a href="https://xiongyingfei.github.io/">Yingfei Xiong</a>. I am interested in program synthesis. Click <a href="/research">here</a> for more about my research.
</p>

<p> I completed my undergraduate at <a href="http://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>, where I worked with Prof. <a href="https://xiongyingfei.github.io/">Yingfei Xiong</a> on interactive program synthesis.

</p>

<p>

I used to be a contestant in competitive programming. I won the 3rd place, Gold medal in ACM/ICPC World Finals 2018. Now I'm still engaging in relevant activities. I'm the founder and the first president of PKU Student Algorithm Association.  Click <a href="/activity">here</a> for more about our activities.

### News

<ul>

<li><strong>January 1, 2024</strong> Our paper <a href="/research#TOPLAS24">Decomposition-Based Synthesis for Applying D&C-Like Algorithmic Paradigms</a> has been accepted at TOPLAS. This is actually the first paper I worked on after I began my PhD, and it is finally accepted after three years of struggling. In this paper, we propose a new type of synthesis tasks, namely lifting problems, to uniformly capture the application of a series of algorithmic paradigms (e.g., divide-and-conquer, incremental computation, and single-pass) and then proposes an effective decomposition-based synthesizer for these tasks.</li>


<li><strong>September 22, 2023</strong> I will present my current research topic <a href="/research#SPLASH23DS">Scaling up Program Synthesis to Efficient Algorithms</a> at SPLASH '23 Doctoral Symposium.</li>

<li><strong>February 26, 2023</strong> Our paper <a href="/research#OOPSLA23">Improving Oracle-Guided Inductive Synthesis by Efficient Question Selection</a> has been accepted at OOPSLA'23. In this paper, we design an efficient question selector that achieves general improvement for OGIS solvers. It reduces not only the number of OGIS iterations (valuable to interactive tasks) but also the time cost of solving non-interactive tasks.  This paper is a follow-up to our <a href="/research#PLDI20">PLDI'20</a> paper.</li>

<li><strong>October 9, 2022</strong> I am glad to receive Microsoft Research Asia Fellowship (i.e., Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship in the Asia-Pacific area)!</li>

<li><strong>August 31, 2021</strong> Our paper <a href="/research#OOPSLA21">Generalizable Synthesis Through Unification</a> has been accepted at OOPSLA'21. In this paper, we study the generalizability of program synthesizers and design a solver with theoretically guaranteed generalizability based on the framework of synthesis through unification and the theory of Occam learning.</li>

<li><strong>July 11, 2021</strong> PKU Student Algorithm Association successfully organized <a href="/activity#meituan21">the 2021 MeiTuan-Cup Programming Contest</a>. <strong>271 teams</strong> participated in this contest, and 31 of them won awards.
</li>

<li><strong>June 15, 2021</strong> Our paper <a href="/research#ICSME21">Interactive Patch Filtering as Debugging Aid</a> has been accepted at ICSME'21. In this paper, we show that, program repair tools with a low precision can become useful with a paper interaction tool. This paper is a follow-up to our <a href="/research#PLDI20">PLDI'20</a> paper.</li>

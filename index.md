Hello,  I am Ruyi Ji (吉如一). Welcome to my home page.

</p>

<p>

I'm now a third-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="http://115.27.245.253/cxyysys/index.htm">Programming Language Lab (PLL)</a> at <a href="http://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="http://sei.pku.edu.cn/~hu/">Zhenjiang Hu</a> and Prof. <a href="https://xiongyingfei.github.io/">Yingfei Xiong</a>. I am interested in program synthesis. Click <a href="">here</a> for more about my research.
</p>

<p> I completed my undergraduate at <a href="http://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>, where I worked with Prof. <a href="https://xiongyingfei.github.io/">Yingfei Xiong</a> on interactive program synthesis.

</p>

<p>

I used to be a contestant in competitive programming. I won the 3rd place, Gold medal in ACM/ICPC World Finals 2018. Now I'm still engaging in relevant activities. I'm the founder and the first president of PKU Student Algorithm Association.  Click <a href="">here</a> for more about our activities.

<li><strong>October 9, 2022</strong> I am glad to receive Microsoft Research Asia Fellowship (i.e., Microsoft Research Ph.D. Fellowship in the Asia-Pacific area)!</li>

<li><strong>August 31, 2021</strong> Our paper <a href="/research/#OOPSLA21">Generalizable Synthesis Through Unification</a> has been accepted at OOPSLA'21. In this paper, we study the generalizability of program synthesizers and design a solver with theoretically guaranteed generalizability based on the framework of synthesis through unification and the theory of Occam learning.</li>

<li><strong>July 11, 2021</strong> PKU Student Algorithm Association successfully organized <a href="/activity/#meituan21">the 2021 MeiTuan-Cup Programming Contest</a>. <strong>271 teams</strong> participated in this contest, and 31 of them won awards.

<li><strong>June 15, 2021</strong> Our paper <a href="/research/#ICSME21">Interactive Patch Filtering as Debugging Aid</a> has been accepted at ICSME'21. In this paper, we show that, program repair tools with a low precision can become useful with a paper interaction tool. This paper is a follow-up to our <a href="/research/#PLDI20">PLDI'20</a> paper.</li> 

<li><strong>December 6, 2020</strong> PKU Student Algorithm Association successfully organized <a href="/activity/#sensetime">the 2020 SenseTime-Cup Programming Contest</a>. This contest is jointly organized by us and BUPT ZhouXing Algorithm Association, and is supported by <a href="https://www.sensetime.com/en">SenseTime</a>. </li>

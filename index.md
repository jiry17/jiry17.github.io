Hello,  I am Ruyi Ji (吉如一). Welcome to my home page.

</p>

<p>

I'm now a first-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="http://115.27.245.253/cxyysys/index.htm">Programming Language Lab (PLL)</a> at <a href="http://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="http://sei.pku.edu.cn/~hu/">Zhenjiang Hu</a> and Prof. <a href="https://xiongyingfei.github.io/">Yingfei Xiong</a>. I am interested in program synthesis. Click <a href="">here</a> for more about my research.
</p>

<p> I completed my undergraduate at <a href="http://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>, where I worked with Prof. <a href="https://xiongyingfei.github.io/">Yingfei Xiong</a> on interactive program synthesis.

</p>

<p>

I used to be a contestant in competitive programming. I won the 3rd place, Gold medal in ACM/ICPC World Finals 2018. Now I'm still engaging in relevant activities. I'm the founder and the first president of PKU Student Algorithm Association.  Click <a href="">here</a> for more about our activities.

<li><strong>December 6, 2020</strong> PKU Student Algorithm Association successfully organized <a href="/activity/#sensetime">the 2020 SenseTime-Cup Programming Contest</a>. This contest is jointly organized by us and BUPT ZhouXing Algorithm Association, supported by <a href="https://www.sensetime.com/en">SenseTime</a>. </li>

<li><strong>November 22, 2020</strong> I'm invited to set problems for <a href="/activity/#xiaomi2020">The 2020 ICPC China Beijing Xiaomi Invitational Programming Contest</a>. 3037 teams participated in its online contest, and 103 among them advanced to the onsite.</li>

<li><strong> October 1, 2020</strong> I'm excited that our paper <a href="/research/#OOPSLA20">Guiding Dynamic Programing via Structural Probability for Accelerating Programming by Example</a> has been accepted at OOPSLA'20. This paper combines structural probability and dynamic programming to faster solve programming-by-example tasks. Our approach, <i>MaxFlash</i>, achieved 4x-2080x speed-ups against SOTA synthesizers.  </li>
